# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### NAME HERE

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
It was required to be assigned to the submission file with a count column

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
WeightedEnsemble_L2

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
By viewing the histogram to see how count is matching with different features

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
Not much in my case

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
Not much in my case

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
Data Analysis

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|?|?|?|?|
|add_features|?|?|?|?|
|hpo|?|?|?|?|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

## Summary
This was an good intial excercise to go through different concepts and practice them.
